    1. The form element is a container element like a div
    2. The form element wraps all of the inputs a user will interact with on a form
    3. The form element takes two essential attributes: action (which takes a URL that tells the form where it shold send its data to) and method (tells the browser which HTTP request method it should use to submit the form, GET or POST)
    4. GET is used when we want to retrieve something from a server (google search result), POST is used to change something on a server (account creation, make a payment, etc)

    Syntax:

    <form action="example.com/path" method="post">

    </form>
    
    -->
  </body>
